## Purpose
This is an open source project that gives the developer the opportunity to practice using firebase. It starts off creating a train schedule with arrival time and departure times hosted on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station. [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) is used to manipulate data.
